## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: High School Math (Grade 9–12)  
- **➗ Topic**: Rational Expressions — Understanding the concept of rational expressions and how to simplify, add, subtract, multiply, and divide them  
- **📏 Common Core**:  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSA.APR.D.6** – Rewrite simple rational expressions in different forms; write a(x) / b(x) in the form q(x) + r(x) / b(x), where a(x), b(x), and r(x) are polynomials with degrees less than the degree of b(x), using inspection, long division, or synthetic division.  
  - **CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSA.APR.D.7** – Understand that rational expressions form a system analogous to the rational numbers, closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by a nonzero rational expression.
